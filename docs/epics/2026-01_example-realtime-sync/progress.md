## Notes for Next Session

This is an example epic showing how the harness works. Use it as a template for your own epics:
- `epic.md` explains what you're building in plain language
- `feature_list.json` lists every feature with exact test steps
- Each session, pick one failing feature, implement it, verify it, mark it done
- Update this file after each session so the next session knows where to start

Happy building!
